In CS8, we present lots of problems that use the accumulator pattern with a for loop;
this method of problem solving is known as <strong>iteration</strong>.

An alternative method that we sometimes cover is <strong>recursion</strong>.

For many problems, there is a third approach using a method using tools
from a technique known as <strong>functional programming</strong>.   

* This is typically <strong>not</strong> a topic covered in CS8.  
* This material is <strong>probably not</strong> 
   to be needed for your homework, labs, or exams (unless your instructor indicates
   otherwise, which is again, unlikely).
* It is provided ONLY for students that are already
   feeling confident with the core CS8 material and would like 
   <strong>an additional challenge.</strong>
