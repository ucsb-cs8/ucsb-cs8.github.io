If you want to go beyond the basics in Python, and use Python as a serious tool for number crunching, either for the natural sciences
(e.g. Biology, Chemistry, Physics, etc) or the social sciences (Anthropology, Sociology, etc.) the following packages may be worth
investigating further.

* numpy: Adds an `array` type to Python that makes working with numerical data (especially matrices) more straightforward
   * [Introduction to numpy,scipi,matplotlib](https://scipy.org/getting-started.html)
* scipy: Adds routines useful for scientific computation, such as computing integrals numerically, solving differential equations, optimization, and sparse matrices.
   * [Introduction to numpy,scipi,matplotlib](https://scipy.org/getting-started.html)
* matplotlib: Plotting and Graphing tools
   * [Introduction to numpy,scipi,matplotlib](https://scipy.org/getting-started.html)
* Anaconda: The most relevant Python software for data analysis all in one package
   * [Anaconda Introduction (from their own website)](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)
   
* Jupyter notebooks (formery known as iPython notebooks): a web platform for communicating scientific computing results, not just in Python, but other languages as well.
   * [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/)

# Learning numpy,scipy,matplotlib

For UC students, a variety of helpful books on a variety of computing topics can be found if you access the following site from either an on campus network address, or use the VPN for your campus (e.g. [the UCSB VPN](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/services/using-vpn):

* [http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/)

At that site, search for any topic related to computing.   A search on numpy brought up this just on the first screen of results.   Each of those is a link to a full-text ebook:
