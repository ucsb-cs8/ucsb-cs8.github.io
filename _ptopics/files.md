# Opening and Closing Files

The simplest code to open an input file looks like this (see p. 109 in Perkovic 2nd edition)

```
infile = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

If you do it this way, you have the obligation to later close the file, like this, when you are finished with it:

```
infile.close()
```

A way that may Python programmers prefer is to use a `with` statement, like this:

```
  with open('example.txt','r') as infile:
     data = infile.read()
```

With this style of coding, all the code you want to do while the file is open is done inside the indented
`with` block.   The file `infile` is automatically closed as soon as the indented block is exited.

# Reading from a file

## Read the whole file at once

This code reads the entire contents of the file into the variable `data`.  

```
  with open('example.txt','r') as infile:
     data = infile.read()
```

If you want to treat the different lines of the file as separate lines after that, you could use this code
 to convert `data` to a list of strings called `lines`, one per line:

```
  lines = data.split("\n")
```

That's only a good idea if the file is relatively small.

## Read one line at a time

This code will read every line from an input file and print each one out to the screen:

```

```

This code will read every line from an input file and print each one out to the screen after converting to lowercase:


This code will accumulate all of the lines in the file into a list:

This code will count the number of lines in the file:
