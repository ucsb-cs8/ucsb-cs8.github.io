In Python 3, we can format the way output appears using the `format` method of string
objects.

Those statements look like this:

```
   print('a={:5} b={:7}'.format(a,b))
```

To understand what this will print, you can consult any of the following resources:

* Chapter 4, pages 100-105 in the Perkovic 2nd Edition Textbook.
* This [tutorial from digitalocean on string formatters in Python3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3)
