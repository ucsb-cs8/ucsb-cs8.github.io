# Outline

* Create a free Heroku account
* Create a free Github account (it not already done)
* Put your existing Flask web app in a Github repo
* Add files needed for Heroku
* Create Heroku Webapp
* Link Heroku webapp with Github repo
* See Heroku webapp live

# Step 1: Create a free Heroku account

Navigate to [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/) and create a free account. 

* As of this writing (May 2018), NO CREDIT CARD was needed to create a free tier account that can create up to five webapps.
* If that changes, please let me know.
* You should not need to enter a credit card for any of the activities in this tutorial or the ones that follow.

# Step 2:  Create a free Github account (it not already done)

If you don't already have a github.com account, create one now at [https://github.com](https://github.com).  If you do have one,log into the [https://github.com](https://github.com) web site.

# Step 3: Put your existing Flask web app in a Github repo

If you don't already have your existing flask web app in a public github repo, upload it to a github repo.

The steps to do that are covered at the series of github lessons that can be found here: [https://ucsb-cs8.github.io/topics/git/](https://ucsb-cs8.github.io/topics/git/)

You need the Flask webapp in a public github repo before you can deploy it to Heroku.

# Step 4: Add files needed for Heroku

To deploy on Heroku, you need two additional files:

* `Procfile`
* `requirements.txt`

Here's what goes in those files:
