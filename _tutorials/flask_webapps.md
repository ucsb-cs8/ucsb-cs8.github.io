This is a set of tutorials for getting started with building simple
webapps using Python.   These tutorials use a framework known as `Flask`.

`Flask` is not the only Python webapp framework, and it may not even be the
best Python webapp framework for all purposes.  It is, undoubtedly, the easiest
to get started with in an introductory course.
