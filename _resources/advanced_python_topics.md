Here are some advanced topics in Computing and Computer Science that can be explored with your Python skills.

Please note that the items on this list tend to be "far beyond the scope of an intro level course".   They are not items that we'd expect
a typical CS8 student to dive into.  However, not every CS8 student is "typical", and we want to be sure that there are challenges
for everyone.

* Symbolic Computation in Python: <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>
   * Symbolic Computation involves computing with algebraic expressions rather than with numbers.  Examples include simplifying algebraic expressions and finding integrals and derivatives 
      symbolically.  You may be used to using systems such as Wolfram Alpha or Mathematical for this application.
