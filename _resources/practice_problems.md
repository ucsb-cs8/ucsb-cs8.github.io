# Functions over lists

Try each of these with iteration (i.e. a for loop).

If you are familiar with recursion, you can also try solving them with recursion.

* Write a function `runningSum(numlist)` that, for a list of numbers, returns the running sum of that list.
   ```
   assert runningSum([10,5,10,5,-5,10])==[10,15,25,30,25,35]
   assert runningSum([1,2,3,4,5])==[1,3,6,10,15]
   ```
