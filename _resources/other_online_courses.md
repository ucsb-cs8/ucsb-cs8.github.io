I am sometimes asked about online courses, especially by students frustrated about the difficulty of getting into CS courses at UCSB 
as non-majors.

There are dozens of options, and I have very few recommendations, mostly because I don't have time to go through and vet them all.

There are a small number, however, that I have either direct experience with, or that come highly recommended from trusted colleagues.
Here is that list.


# C++

* The CS 10 V and CS 12 V series from UC Riverside, available through UC Online.

# Java

* THe Coursera sequence <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented> created by a team at UC San Diego.
