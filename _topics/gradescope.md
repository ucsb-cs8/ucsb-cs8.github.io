## Link to Gradescope

<http://gradescope.com>

## How do I login?  

Your login is typically your umail address.  Check your umail for an invitation, or try clicking "Forgot my password" and then try the "Reset your password" option
using your umail address.

If that still doesn't work, contact the instructor.  (TAs, please check in with the instructor before adding anyone to gradescope yourself.)
