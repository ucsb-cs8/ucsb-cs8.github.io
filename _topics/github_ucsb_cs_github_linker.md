If your instructor has:
* enabled a Github Organization for your course
* set that Github Organization up using the [ucsb-cs-github-linker](https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com) webapp

then this page will walk you through the process of getting setup with access to those resources.

# Step 1: Create a github.com account

Go to <https://github.com> and create an account on the free plan.

If you already have an account, go to step 2.

# Step 2: Add your `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu` to the list of emails on your Github account.

* Go to the settings for your github account (menu upper right)
* Go to "emails".  Or while logged in, visit: <https://github.com/settings/emails>
* Add your `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu` to the list of emails on your Github account.

# Step 3: Verify your `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu` email address

You should see something like this:

* `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu Unverified Verification email sent. `

Go to your email and look for the verification email.  Click to verify the email.  If you can't find it, click to resend the verification email.

# Step 4: Use your Github account to login to the [ucsb-cs-github-linker](https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com) webapp

At the address: <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com> there is a webapp that will allow you to join the github
organization for your course.

To be able join, the following must all be true:

1.  Your instructor has registered a github org for the course
2.  You are in the course roster, and your instructor has uploaded the course roster to the app
3.  Your email on the course roster (e.g. `cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu`) matches one on the course roster.

If that's true, then logging in and selecting the course will get you an *invitation* to join the course.

You still have to *accept* the invitation. Then you'll be in the course organization.
