You can scan your assignment to PDF from any iOS or Android device.

Instructions are available here: <http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs32/15F/pdf/GradescopeSubmissionHelp.pdf>

There are also PDF scanners available for Windows Phone&mdash;do a web search on "Windows Phone PDF Scanner".

# Scan your pages in the correct order!!!

The result should be a two page PDF, with page 1 first, and page 2 second.

You may be penalized if your submission has the pages in the incorrect order.

Your resulting PDF should be exactly won

# Alternative: editing the PDF (no scanning needed)

An alternative is to:
1. Get an electronic copy of the homework assignment from the website
2. Save to PDF (On Mac, you can "print to PDF", for example.)
3. Use software that edits/annotates PDFs to enter your answers directly.
4. Upload that PDF.
